## Converting Amp Skills to Cursor Rules

If you have additional Amp skills in `amp-skills-main/`, you can convert them:

1. Copy the skill's `SKILL.md` file content
2. Remove Amp-specific frontmatter (name, description with triggers)
3. Remove Amp CLI-specific commands
4. Adapt to Cursor IDE context
5. Save as `.cursor/rules/[skill-name].md`

## Notes

- These rules are converted from Amp skills but adapted for Cursor IDE
- Original skills are preserved in `amp-skills-main/` for reference
- Rules can be customized for your project's specific needs

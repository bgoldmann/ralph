# Xcode 26 Developer Tools

Guide for Xcode 26 (2026) tools, build system, LLM-powered coding assistance, and development workflow.

## Xcode 26 Overview

- **Coding Tools**: LLM-powered coding assistant—inline code changes, documentation generation, fixes via natural language
- **Swift Build**: Xcode uses open-source Swift Build engine for builds
- **Requirements**: Apple silicon + macOS Tahoe for full Coding Tools
- **Download**: [Xcode 26 beta](https://developer.apple.com/download/)

## Coding Tools (LLM Integration)

- Natural-language code generation and inline edits
- Documentation generation
- Bug fixes and refactoring suggestions
- Use when iterating on Swift/SwiftUI code in Xcode

## Build System

- **Swift Build**: open-source build engine used by Xcode
- Faster incremental builds
- Better build caching and parallelization

## Editor & Workspace

- Redesigned Tab experience
- Improved navigation and workspace organization
- Playground macro for previewing non-UI code interactively

## Debugging & Performance

- **Instruments**: ProcessorTrace, CPUCounter, SwiftUI instrument
- Improved debugging tools
- Profile CPU, power, and SwiftUI performance

## Testing

- Record/replay/maintain XCUIAutomation (XCTest UI) tests
- Test plan replay across locales and devices
- Use XCTest for unit and UI tests

## Icon Composer

- Multi-layer icon authoring
- Dynamic previews
- Use for Liquid Glass–compatible app icons

## Cursor + iOS Development (Sweetpad, Inject)

Develop iOS apps in Cursor with build, run, and hot-reload support:

### Sweetpad
- **VS Code / Cursor extension** – Build, run, and manage iOS apps from Cursor
- Install Sweetpad, open `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`
- Use Sweetpad commands: Build & Run, pick simulator/device, deploy
- Optional: `xcode-build-server` (Homebrew) for autocomplete; `swiftformat` for formatting
- [Sweetpad](https://github.com/sweetpad-dev/sweetpad)

### Hot Reload (Inject / HotSwiftUI)
- Combine **Inject** or **HotSwiftUI** with Sweetpad for live SwiftUI updates in simulator
- Add to views for hot-reload: `@ObserveInjection var redraw` and `.enableInjection()` in body
- Use InjectionIII macOS app or Inject library; HotSwiftUI provides SwiftUI helpers
- Changes appear in simulator without full rebuild

### When to Use Xcode
- Signing, capabilities, entitlements
- Interface Builder, Asset Catalogs
- Debugging with breakpoints, Instruments
- App Store Connect, TestFlight

## Workflow Tips

1. Use Xcode 26 beta for iOS 26 / Foundation Models development
2. Enable Coding Tools for AI-assisted editing (Apple silicon + macOS Tahoe required)
3. Use Sweetpad + Inject for Cursor-based iOS development and hot reload
4. Profile with Instruments before release
5. Use Icon Composer for new Liquid Glass–style icons

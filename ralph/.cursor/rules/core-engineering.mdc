# Core Engineering Standards

- Write maintainable, readable, convention-driven code.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Always generate or update tests for new logic, refactors, or bug fixes.
- Avoid new dependencies unless necessary.
- When no specific rule applies, follow existing codebase patterns.

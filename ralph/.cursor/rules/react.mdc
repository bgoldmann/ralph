# React Development Guide (Index)

The React guide is split into three focused rules (each under ~500 lines) for better composability and agent selection:

| Rule | Content |
|------|--------|
| **react-components.mdc** | Components, composition, conditional rendering, lists & keys, best practices, common patterns, checklist |
| **react-hooks.mdc** | useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback, custom hooks, useRef |
| **react-state.mdc** | State management patterns, event handling, forms, performance (memo, code splitting), error boundaries, testing |

Use `@react-components`, `@react-hooks`, or `@react-state` for targeted context, or rely on auto-attach (same globs) so all three apply when working in `**/*.tsx` or `**/*.jsx` files.

## Quick reference

- **Components:** Functional components, TypeScript interfaces, composition, children/slots.
- **Hooks:** See `react-hooks.mdc` for full hook API and examples.
- **State & perf:** Lifting state, Context, memo, lazy, error boundaries – see `react-state.mdc`.

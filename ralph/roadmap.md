# Ralph Roadmap

Milestones and future directions for Ralph. Use for long-term planning and incremental development.

## Current (2026)

- Agent-driven workflow via `/ralph-workflow`; `ralph.sh` for interactive use.
- Cursor 2026 rules: 39 .mdc rules; React split into react-components, react-hooks, react-state.
- Skills in `.cursor/skills/`; optional `.github/agents/` (ralph-agent, prd-agent).
- Docs: instructions.md, AGENTS.md, roadmap.md, .cursorignore.

## Near-term

- Keep flowchart app in sync with workflow steps.
- Keep rules under ~500 lines; maintain globs and descriptions.
- Skills include explicit verification steps.

## Future ideas

- Broader `.github/agents/` and copilot-instructions for Cursor + Copilot teams.
- Optional docs-agent, test-agent, lint-agent under `.github/agents/`.
- PRD tooling: markdown to prd.json conversion and validation.
- Optional metrics on rule/skill usage.
